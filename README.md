Just fishing :)

This github repo only shows implemented code and will not show any in-progress code for features unreleased. This repo uses a text based interpretation of the code blocks in DiamondFire and is the syntax of a language I made that a friend of mine suggested I name "External Spark".
The ".cwd" in the file extension stands for "Command Written DiamondFire".
Everything about this language is completely personal use because it's coded extremely poorly, so take every bit of syntax as with a grain of salt.

I do not code like this often, but can if I want to. Right now, I'm just translating what I have in game to text that makes semi-sense, effectively, if you were to recreate it yourself.
